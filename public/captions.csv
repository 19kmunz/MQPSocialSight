C2,"I see negative conversation (ex. disputes, name-calling, trolling) on the platform.","This question aims to understand the frequency of negative environments on social media. In general, users do often see negative conversation on social media, less frequently than positive conversation.","Users frequently see negativity.

Users see close friends in a personal community, which tends to be positive.","Users occasionally see negativity. Some communities or users may debate or troll to upset others, but this will depend on comments and the type of video being watched.","Users see negativity rarely.

This is a hostile environment with trolling and argument.","Users occasionally or rarely see negativity. Some communities or users may debate or troll to upset others. Less personal relationships cause more negativity and random chatters can be negative, but it largely depends who you watch."
C3,I see perspectives and opinions that are different from my own on the platform.,"Seeing different opinions is both good and bad, as it prevents echo chambers but may cause discomfort. In general users occasionally see opinions that differ from theirs.","Users occasionally see different perspectives from theirs. This may be linked with negative conversation, or from following family with varied opinion.","Users occasionally see different perspectives from theirs, but will usually share similar perspectives as their peers.",Users frequently see differing views.

This may be echo chamber to some perspectives.","Users occasionally see views that differ from theirs, but many responses rarely see these views.

This may be an echo chamber of opinions, or friends not posting opinions often.","Users very frequently see differing views, in a nearly unanimous response. 4chan promotes free speech, which will welcome a wide variety of opinions.","Most users say they rarely see differing opinions. This may be an echo chamber, or a lack of voiced opinions since most streams are focused on gaming."
C4,The platform prioritizes my friendsâ€™ posts over other posts.,"Overall, social media was built on friendly connections, but, in recent years, sponsored and recommended content is making waves.","Facebook remains a popular platform for connecting with loved ones, however, the platform frequently displays newsfeed and recommended content. Although users still primarily see posts from their friends, there is a tight balance between these posts and the suggested content, while other social media platforms, like BeReal and Instagram, place a greater emphasis on personal connections.","Although LinkedIn is definitely a platform to connect with coworkers, your feed may have a mix of corporate and personal posts. Respondents tend to agree that the feed tends to prioritize connections, but not as strongly as places like Instagram or BeReal. Once again, we are unsure if our respondents tend to use the feed or just the profile features, so these answers may be skewed.","User opinion is highly varied, but tends to agree somewhat. You will definitely still see the posts of users you follow, but sites like BeReal and Instagram are stronger in this regard.","Users tend to agree that they will see their friends first. Instagram still tends to be a place to follow friends and post photos, even if recommended content is being pushed more into the feed. ","Users disagree, as following users is not emphasized. Reddit tends not to show you content from users you know or follow, instead using its community structure to show you posts from your requested circles. ","Users tend to agree, with some variance. Tumblr has a strong culture of becoming friends with ""mutuals,"" which is when you follow someone and they follow you back.","Users tend to disagree. TikTok tends not to show you content from users you know or follow, instead relying on it recommendation algorithm to keep you interested.","Users overwhelmingly agree. Since BeReal's feed is only friends, it is unique.","Users disagree. YouTube tends not to show you content from users you know or follow, instead relying on it recommendation algorithm to keep your attention.","Users strongly agree. Snapchat has lost many influencers, and the main features are mostly messaging friends and viewing friends' stories.","Users unanimously disagree. The anonymity on 4chan means that you will not know who other users are. This isn't the space to see users you know in real life, and a lack of usernames means you cannot add friends.","Users tend to disagree. Twitch tends not to show you content from users you know or prioritize friends, instead emphasizing streamers you follow."
C5,The platform prioritizes sponsored posts over other posts.,This question aims to understand whether user communities and their posts are prioritized over advertisements and sponsorships.,"Users strongly agree that Facebook prioritizes sponsored posts, meaning that corporate interest may be prioritized over user posts. Meta Inc. is well known for profiting off of advertisements.","Responses vary, but users tend to slightly agree that sponsored posts are prioritized. While sponsorship is common, other posts are still very much visible.","Responses vary, but users tend to slightly agree that sponsored posts are prioritized. While sponsorship is common, other posts are still very much visible.","Users strongly agree that sponsored posts are prioritized, meaning that corporate interest may be prioritized over user posts. Facebook follows in agreement, and Meta Inc. is well known for profiting off of advertisements.","Users slightly disagree, and believe that sponsored posts are not prioritized. These communities feel more natural, and less corporate.","Users largely disagree, and believe that sponsored posts are not prioritized. It is also possible that users viewing Tumblr's website use ad blockers.","Responses vary, but users tend to slightly agree that sponsored posts are prioritized. While sponsorship is common, other posts are still very much visible.","Users uniquely strongly disagree, since BeReal has no ads or sponsorships.","Users agree that sponsored posts are a priority. YouTube features ads before and during videos, which are often unskippable. Similar to Meta Inc., YouTube is owned by Google, which is a high-profit company.","Responses vary significantly. Snapchat features a large amount of ads between stories and on the Discover page, but users are not sure whether these sponsored posts are prioritized.","Users strongly disagree. 4chan has sponsored ads at the top of forums, but not within posts. Additionally, 4chan is a website, meaning users may use ad-blockers.","Responses vary, but users tend to slightly agree that sponsored posts are prioritized. While sponsorship is common, other posts are still very much visible."
C6,I see two-way discussion between content creators and audiences on the platform.,"In general, users say they occasionally see two-way discussion on social media. ","Most users agree that two-way discussion is common, and users overwhelmingly see discussion frequently. This may be because users often respond to posts from friends and family on their feed.","Most users occasionally or rarely see two-way discussion. This may be because LinkedIn is a professional environment with users discussing topics such as new jobs, research and new ideas.","Users say that they frequently see two-way discussion. This may be due to Twitter's reply feature allowing for easy, brief responses to posts.","Users say that they occasionally see two-way discussion. Instagram is not built for long-form conversation, but users may spend time having discussions in the comments of posts.","Most users see two-way discussion, with responses leaning towards frequently and very frequently. Due to Reddit's nature as a forum-based social media, many posts are written with the intention of starting a conversation for users to reply to.","There is high variance, but users tend to see two-way discussion very frequently. Tumblr's layout of reblogs and replies makes it very easy to see responses to posts.","There is high variance, with most users occasionally seeing two-way discussion. While duets, live streams and comments are means to have two-way discussions, they are not frequent.","Users see two-way discussion are either ""frequently"" or ""never."" Since this is friends-only, this is contingent on whether or not your friends will respond to each other's posts.","Users see two-way discussion occasionally or rarely. Creators may respond to comments or other creators, but discussion is not a priority.","Most users say they rarely or never see two-way discussion. Since replies and messages are private, it is difficult to tell.",This response is too low confidence for us to draw meaningful conclusions.,"Users see two-way discussion very frequently, as streamers tend to respond to chatters."
C7,It is easy to make new friends on the platform.,"This question was aimed whether users are able to expand their community by making new personal connections. In general, social media users tend to slightly disagree, thus making new friends on social media tends to be somewhat difficult.","In general, users agree that it is easy to make new friends. There are a considerable number of users that disagree, and this may depend on your involvement in groups or other pages, or whether you reach out to distant connections.","In general, users slightly agree that it is easy to make new friends. This may be because LinkedIn recommends users within the same organizations, so they may suggest people you know or have similar interest to. ","While user responses have a slight lean towards agreeing, the responses vary significantly. Users may find it easy or difficult to make friends, depending on their environment and who they follow.","Users slightly disagree that making new friends is easy on Instagram. This may be because users tend to follow pre-existing friends, and may not message strangers often.","Users overwhelmingly disagree that it is easy to make new friends. This may be because Reddit is topic driven and does not emphasize following other users, and conversations are often tied to a specific topic or subject.","Although there are few responses, users tend to agree that making new friends on Tumblr is easy. This may be due to Tumblr's culture of ""mutual"" followers, and the ability to chat via replying to posts or reblogging.","In general, users disagree that you can make new friends easily. Since you often cannot message users that are not following you, communication is de-emphasized.","There are very few responses to this question, with most users either slightly agreeing or disagreeing. This may be because BeReal prioritizes your existing friends, and does not aim for you to make new friends through the platform.","Users strongly disagree that it is easy to make friends. YouTube has no way to message other users or add friends, and recommends content for entertainment over connection.","Responses vary here. In general, users slightly disagree, but many users do also agree. This may be subjective since Snapchat relies primarily on pre-existing friendships, through which some users are able to make new friends by being added to group chats with potential new friends.","Users strongly disagree. 4chan allows no usernames or direct messaging, so staying in contact with another anonymous user will be difficult unless one of you were willing to post contact information publicly.","Responses vary, but users slightly disagree. This is because Twitch's design focuses more on individual streams rather than direct interaction between users, however users may still make friends from these streamer's communities."

Often these are users that users know, or friends of their friends, so this close connection helps users feel more real.",Users tend to slightly agree that users feel like real individuals. This may be due to LinkedIn's professional nature and the frequency of recruiters who use automated messages to reach potential candidates.,"Users slightly agree that they are interacting with individuals, although a considerable amount disagrees. This may be due to bots, or because 280-character text posts lose some nuance of real users.","Users slightly agree that they are interacting with individuals, although a considerable amount disagrees. On Instagram, posts may be filtered to show a person's ideal image, which may feel less real.","Users slightly agree that they are interacting with individuals, although a considerable amount disagrees. Some users may be trolling or feel ""fake.""","Users tend to agree. This may be due to Tumblr's niche user base, who tend to be younger and more authentic.","Users slightly agree that they are interacting with individuals, although a considerable amount disagrees. 60 second videos may also lose nuance similar to Twitter.","Users overwhelmingly agree. This is the idea behind BeReal, that you see your friends being authentic.","Varied answers, but users slightly agree. Users don't tend to interact with creators, but comments may feel like bots.","Users agree. They are mostly interacting with their friends. But similar to Instagram, Snapchat has filters and may feel less authentic.","This response is too low confidence for us to draw meaningful conclusions, but users do disagree often, which may be due to a high presence of trolls",Users tend to agree. Streams are slow-paced and users likely gravitate towards streams that feel personable and authentic. The concept of streams being live also makes creators feel more real.

Facebook more personal, revolving around the traditional profile and feed of friends/following posts.","Users tend to agree.

BeReal is all about authentic identity.,"Users generally disagree. Identity is not emphasized compared to viewing, and users are not incentivized to post.","Users tend to agree.

S4,The platform enables me to customize my profile.,"In general, users agree that social media allows profile customization. However the more customization, the more the social media promotes self identity.","Users agree strongly that Facebook enables profile customization. This includes headers and profile pictures, however all posts also appear on the user's profile.","Users strongly that LinkedIn enables profile customization. This is one of LinkedIn's key features, as your profile showcases your professional identity and contains your skills and experiences.","Users agree that Twitter allows profile customization to an extent. However this is limited to profile picture, header and description.","Users agree that Instagram allows profile customization to an extent. However this is primarily limited to profile picture, header and description. Instagram does also allow users to feature stories on their profile as well.","Users slightly agree that Reddit enables customization. This includes a profile picture, banner, display name and about section, but since following is de-emphasized, these features are entirely based on preference.","Most users strongly agree.

Users do not consider their friends to be creators, and Snapchat hosts creators but these are not emphasized.","This response has high variance and low confidence.

Users may be checking for updates, sending quick messages, or briefly updating their profiles.","Most users spend less than ten minutes on Twitter.

This may be due to Twitter's content being limited to 280 characters.","Most users spend less than ten minutes on Instagram, but there is high variance. While viewing a few posts would require spending less than ten seconds, Instagram features messaging and video reels which may cause users to spend more time on the app.","While most users spend less than ten minutes on Reddit, the amount of time spent varies. Reddit posts may be longer-form, and reading and responding to detailed posts may take considerable time.","There is high variance, but most tumblr users spend 30 minutes or less on the platform. Posts may be longer-form content, or users may enjoy posts more often.","TikTok has the highest amount of responses using the app in sessions of less than ten minutes or more than one hour. Despite TikToks being one minute or less, meaning that users can view one or two TikToks then close the apQ, however the algorithm is also good at recommending more content to watch.","Unanimously, all users spend less than ten minutes per session. This is because BeReal has very little content, aside from posting within a 2 minute window and viewing friends' posts.","Watch time varies, but most users spend well beyond 10 minutes on YouTube. This is because most videos that are not YouTube Shorts are above ten minutes, with many streams and videos spanning over an hour","Nearly everyone uses Snapchat for ten minutes or less.

Friends are not always entertaining, and Snapchat's Discover content is not appealing.",This response is too low confidence for us to draw meaningful conclusions.,"Users are very frequently entertained, as they self-select into streams to watch based on their interests."
D6,I am educated by the content on the platform.,"In general, users are occasionally educated by content on their social media platforms","Many users say they are occasionally educated by Facebook, but most say they are rarely or never educated. This may be due to the personal style of many posts, as well as misinformation.","Users are often educated by content on LinkedIn, with most respondents answering frequently or occasionally. LinkedIn is for professionals and academics, thus posts will often contain educational information about research or a new discovery.",Users are occasionally or rarely entertained. Twitter is a personal platform with unreliable information.,"Users are rarely entertained. Instagram is a personal platform where most users post photos of themselves and their experiences, not educational content.","Users are frequently educated.

However, this result is low confidence.","Most users are rarely educated. Twitch is likely a place for entertainment, not education."
D7,I feel bored/unsatisfied after viewing content on the platform.,"Although you'd except entertainment based platforms to rarely leave users unsatisfied, overall, users are occasionally unsatisfied.","Surprisingly, Facebook is one of the platforms that struggles the most compared to other media we asked about. This could be a variety of reasons, such as not enjoying your connections posts or the recommended content, or that our respondents for facebook skewed older and that generation reflects on their view experience differently. Whatever the reason, keep this in mind!","Infrequent LinkedIn users primarily use it as a digital resume, rather
than for its content. The platform's corporate culture inherently makes 
the content less ""entertaining"" than it's contemporaries, leading to 
occasional user boredom, but this is expected and some users are satisfied with that.","Users were frequently bored, more so than other social media. Although they say they are entertained, this may be due to a weak recommendation algorithm or Twitter's format.",Users are occasionally bored. This may be due to the platform's recommendation algorithm being less effective.,"Users are occasionally bored.

Again, users of tumblr like tumblr's content.",This is one of the platforms that rarely leaves users unsatisfied.

However due to BeReal's format, users know what they are going to see when they open the app.",This is one of the platforms that rarely leaves users unsatisfied. Finishing a long video will likely be entertaining and satisfying.,"Users are frequently unsatisfied. Snapchat's loss of creators in the 2017 redesign has hurt the quality of its content. Users may just click through stories out of habit, not out of satisfaction.","User responses vary significantly. Since 4chan uses a forum structure and lacks recommendations, finding content may not be as satisfying.","Users are rarely unsatisfied, likely because they return to certain streamers that they know are entertaining."
D8,Misinformation is spread through the platform.,"Misinformation is a problem for all platforms, but it is more well known on some than others.","Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal as forever marked it as susceptible to misinformation, especially through it's targeted ads.

A1,I can control what I see on the platform.,"Social media will always be tied to the content a user cultivates, whether that's from following creators or from trying to tune their recommendation algorithm. This isn't always a process that the user will always have minute control of, but the user will play at least a minimal roll.","The recommendation algorithm can feel out of a user's control. Although friendships are valuable on the platform, the lean towards newsfeed and other recommendation algorithms may make the user feel powerless at times.","Users may only user profile features, so the survey responses may not accurately reflect the feed. Overall, posts will be recommended if posted or liked by a connection, so your feed will be linked to your friend's choices.","Users tend to agree. Twitter's recommendation algorithm interjects with content you chose to follow, so some of the content will not be user choice.",Users tend to agree. Instagram is shaped by recommendations and followed content.,"With less emphasis on a recommendation features, users choose which communities they want to view content from.","Users can chose whether or not to enable the recommendation algorithm, so it is possible to only view content from bloggers you chose to follow. Word and tag blocking further let you limit content you do not want to see.","Responses vary, but TikTok's feed is recommendation only.","Users strongly agree, since the friends you choose to add will be the only content you see.","Since YouTube content is videos, it is a choice to watch an consume content. Tiktok has a little less control, as it is based on watch videos recommended for you, while YouTube gives a menu of options which users chose from.","Answers vary wildly here, but most users will be interacting with friends or viewing stories of their close connections. Some of the tabloid content cannot be avoided.","Users strongly disagree. Despite 4chan's topic-based layout, other users may tend to troll other forums.","The long-form nature of Twitch content main users will chose to watch a streamer for a while, and then switch to another. Instead of the scrolling and searching nature of social media, Twitch users tend to chose content for themselves."
A2,I can control the quantity and types of advertisements I see.,Most social media platforms use ads as a primary revenue source.,"Facebook makes $114 Billion dollars annually off of it's ad spots. Although there are some tools for hiding certain ads and understanding what demographics users are targeted as, they may not be widely known or understood by users. ","LinkedIn makes $3B dollars annually off of it's ad spots. There are settings to disable personalized ads and a premium model, which may be why our participants y lean towards slightly disagree over strongly disagree, but this may just as well be because our users may primarily use profile features, when ads show up in the feed.",Twitter earns $231.8B in ad revenue. There are tools to control what ads you see and turn off personalization.,"Instagram earns $17.4B in ad revenue. There are some tools to turn off recommendations, and Instagram also recommends products within its ads.","Reddit earns $438M in ad revenue, which is much lower than other social media.","Tumblr has not released figures on ad revenue. They comply with ad laws in certain states, but turning of personalization may not be available to all users. Tumblr's feature named ""Tumblr Blaze"" allows anyone to push their post as an ad.","TikTok earns $3.9B in advertising revenue, and utilizes tools to understand users' interests and gender targets. But users can turn recommended ads off.",There are no ads!,"YouTube earns $28B in ad revenue.

A3,The platform recommends me content that aligns with my previous interests.,"Social media wants to entertain you, so, overall, all platforms will tend to show you things you are interested in.","Although Facebook's recommendation algorithm will recommend you your interests, it is not as good at it as it's video counterparts. Your connections posts will show up frequently, which may or may not relate to your hobbies. ","LinkedIn is not known for a strong recommendation algorithm. The feed will mostly be comprised of posts your connections have likes or companies you have followed, not recommended content. The professional attitude means much of the content will not align with hobbies, but may align with your professional interests.","Although Twitter recommendation algorithm will recommend you your interests, it is not as strong at it as it's video counterparts.","Although Instagram's recommendation algorithm will recommend you your interests, it is not as strong at it as its video counterparts.","Although Reddit's recommendation or ""hotness"" algorithm will recommend you your interests, it is not as strong at it as its video counterparts.","Tumblr's content depends on what you follow; tags and blogs. Although tumblr is experimenting with recommendation algorithms, the general user base hasn't warmed up to it yet and instead rely on their own content filtering.","Along with Youtube, Tik ok's watch-time based video recommendation algorithm is good at finding videos that align with user interests. As long as you watch videos you are interested in, the algorithm will get better at showing you videos you are interested in. With lower barrier to entry due to shorter videos and trends, there is more content for the algorithm to recommend even faster. ",BeReal does not have a recommendation algorithm. It is exclusively your friend's posts from within the last 24 hours.,"Along with TikTok, Youtube's watch-time based video recommendation algorithm is good at finding videos that align with user interests. As long as you watch videos you are interested in, the algorithm will get better at showing you videos you are interested in.",Snapchat's tabloid content and lack of creators makes it weaker than other social media for recommendations. It is much stronger as a messenger app.,"4chan is known for shocking content and completely lack a recommendation algorithm, so users do not often go there to find stuff they know they will like.","There is high variance in these answers. Twitch tends to recommend channels based on view count or content types you have previously watched (for example, if you watch a streamer play a video game, you may be recommended other streamers playing this game). In general, Twitch is creator driven, so you may be recommended a creator you end up liking even if you don't like the games they play."
A4,I find content on the platform that I wish I had not seen.,"Sometimes the internet will show you content that feels like a waste of time or is actively painful or annoying to think about. In general, this will happen occasionally across all platforms, but some have more shock prone cultures than others.","The recommendation algorithm is not very strong, but can still recommend content that feels like a waste of time or makes your day a little worse. If you can stick to content from trusted loved ones, you may avoid some of this content, but Facebook was one of the lower performing platforms on this question.","Once again, the culture of professionalism keeps shocking content to a minimum.  ","Twitter is completely recommendation algorithm and following based, and sometimes recommendations or followers cannot be predictable.","Instagram is completely recommendation algorithm and following based, and sometimes recommendations or followers cannot be predictable.","Reddit is completely topic based, so users will often know what to expect on the forums they follow.","Tumblr is mainly following based. Surprising and strange content may still pop up on your dash, but high moderation tools let users control what they do not want to see.","TikTok is completely recommendation algorithm based, and sometimes recommendations cannot be predictable.","BeReal's special content design means that the posts you will see are just your friends, so, unless a friend posts something in their one post for the day, you will likely be safe from shocking content.","In general, Youtube prefers to recommend monetized videos, and those tend to follow community guidelines. Although rabbit holes and surprising videos can leave you feeling shocked, Youtube trys to be very business friendly.","Answers vary wildly here, but, most users will be interacting with friends or viewing stories of their close connections. Some of the tabloid content can be shocking, but sticking with content posted by connection will keep you safe.","4chan has low content moderation, and boards like /b/ or /pol/ will have deliberately shocking content. Gore and pornography are frequent.",Twitch has strong community led content moderation.
A5,The platform fosters a safe environment for all users.,"Although many social media strive to encourage a safe environment for all, success varies widely. User culture tends to determine how safe a platform feels, but some recommendation algorithms can lead to dangerous rabbit holes with harmful rhetoric.","Facebook has struggled with its contents moderation. Reportedly, Facebook used to prioritized posts with ""angry"" reactions in the news feed, which was criticized for likely spreading more controversial content that could lead to more controversy within user spaces. Facebook struggles with scammers and data harvesting with third party apps, which can lead to, in the worst cases, identity theft.","LinkedIn lets you privatize almost everything on your profile, with granular preference based on degrees of connection to a person. The business focused culture keep interactions clean and professional, so issues like bullying and hate speech are often mitigated by the culture.","Twitter has a large debate culture, but can have good communities that promote safety.","Instagram is mostly friends so most users will have a safe experience, but there may be discussion of body image issues.","Reddit is known for debate culture, with some niche content that can create unsafe space.","Early Tumblr culture revolved around intensely feminist ideas, which encourage reflection on issues that disadvantaged users face, such members of the LGBT community, users of color, or disabled users. This culture historically was, at times, more argumentative that accepting, but the ideals of their ideologies guide the community to be more understanding than others communities are. Furthermore, Tumblr provides tools to block words or tags to help users moderate their own content. The general culture also encourages blocking other blogs for any reason at all to curate your own experience, further empowering users to create pleasant online spaces for themselves.","TikTok's algorithm creates bubbles that users refer to as ""sides of TikTok,"" which may skew perception of the entire app.","BeReal has high privacy, and the app's culture is based on the culture of each user's friends.","YouTube has less discussion and is more creator led, but algorithm can push dangerous rhetoric. Many users won't see any unsafe content recommended, but some may and some creators may be bullied. ","The disappearing pictures can make sharing risque content tempting, but data hacks make it dangerous. Snap Maps, if left unattended, let any connection know your location, which can be abused. Some believe that the Snapchat filters have led to body dysmorphia in teens. ","4chan is known for shocking content, not user comfort.","Twitch has high moderation tools, and large creators have moderation teams. Twitch recently banned gambling for user safety."
A6,I revisit content on the platform.,"Users tend to revisit content on social media, as they might want to review content they found entertaining, but it varies greatly. This questions hoped to illuminate the searchability of certain websites, as you cannot revisit content if you cannot find it, as well as the value of revisiting content on certain sites.","Many users revisit content from Facebook, whether to share funny videos with friends or to look back on photos with loved ones. The ""saved"" and ""memories"" pages let you look back on content you've made or marked.","LinkedIn content is business focused, so it won't be revisited for entertainment purposes as often as other media. There are features for saving posts and jobs, but those rely on user action, and it;s search features aid primarily in finding pages and current chatter, not revisiting a post. Our users may primarily use profile features, so this data may be skewed.","There is high variance in this response, but when Tweets are so short, they are hard to search. Users that want to revisit content will need to rely on likes and bookmarks.","Responses had high variance, but post search options are limited unless tags are extensively used and, even then, those posts may get drowned out. Users that want to revisit content will need to rely on likes and bookmarks.","Reddit's search features, which can filter by subreddit and search in comments, allows for easy access.","This is one of the highest for revisiting among our participants. Tumblr has tagging which aids searching posts on blogs, and posts can be saved in drafts to revisit.","TikTok has unique video content and culture. Users may want to revisit content to share it with friends, or may be catchy. However videos lack ""titles"" and TikTok's search features are not as strong as YouTube, so users may be unable to re-find content.","BeReal's content disappears after it is ""Time to BeReal"" again, approximately 24 hours.","This is overwhelmingly the top social media website for revisiting content. YouTube's search is advanced, relying on video popularity, titles, tags, and more. YouTube features searchable history and playlist saving, including a Watch Later playlist.","Snapchat content often disappears and cannot be revisited, consistent content is ""tabloid"" content that many do not find worth revisiting.","This response has high variance, but the low search features impede the ability to revisit content.","This response has high variability, but some may replay content from streamers they like while others may only enjoy the live experience."
