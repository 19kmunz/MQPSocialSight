C4,TRUE,The platform prioritizes my friendsâ€™ posts over other posts.,"Overall, social media was built on friendly connections, but, in recent years, sponsored and recommended content is making waves.","Facebook remains a popular platform for connecting with loved ones, however, the platform frequently displays newsfeed and recommended content. Although users still primarily see posts from their friends, there is a tight balance between these posts and the suggested content, while other social media platforms, like BeReal and Instagram, place a greater emphasis on personal connections.","Although LinkedIn is definitely a platform to connect with coworkers, your feed may have a mix of corporate and personal posts. Respondents tend to agree that the feed tends to proiritize connections, but not as strongly as places like Instagram or BeReal. Once again, we are unsure if our respondents tend to use the feed or just the profile features, so these answers may be skewed.","Highly varied, You will definitely still see the postsof people you follow, but the users tend to ""slightly agree,"" while places like BeReal and Instagram are stronger in this regard.","Instagram still tends to be a place to follow friends and post photos, even if recommended content is being pushed more into the feed.

C5,TRUE,The platform prioritizes sponsored posts over other posts.,This question aims to understand whether user communities and their posts are prioritized over advertisements and sponsorships.,"Users strongly agree that Facebook prioritizes sponsored posts, meaning that corporate interest may be prioritized over user posts.

While sponsorship is common, other posts are still very much visible.",
C6,TRUE,I see two-way discussion between content creators and audiences on the platform.,"In general, people say they occasionally see two-way discussion on social media. ","Most people agree that two-way discussion is common on Facebook, and people overwhelmingly see discussion frequently. This may be because people often respond to posts from friends and family on their feed.","Most people occasionally see two-way discussion on LinkedIn, with most responses between being frequent and rare. This may be because LinkedIn is a professional environment with users discussing topics such as new jobs, research and new ideas.","Most people frequently see two-way discussion. This may be due to Twitter's reply feature allowing for easy, brief responses to posts.","People overwhelmingly say tht they occasionally see two-way discussion on Instagram. Instagram is not built for long-form conversation, but users may spend time having discussions in the coments of posts.","Most people see two-way discussion on Reddit, with responses leaning towards frequently or very frequently. Due to Reddit's nature as a forum-based social media, many posts are written with the intention of starting a conversation for users to reply to.","High variance, but people tend to see two-way discussion very frequently. Tumblr makes it very easy to see responses to posts.","There is high variance, with most people occasionally seeing two-way discussion on TikTok. While duets, live streams and comments are means to have two-way discussions, they are not frequent.","Responses are either ""frequently"" or ""never."" Since this is friends-only, this is contingent on whether or not your friends will respond to each other's posts.","Occasionally or rarely, creators may respond to comments but discussion is not a priority","Most conversation is private, most respondents say they rarely see it with many people seeing conversation very rare/never",Too low confidence to say,"Very frequently, streamers tend to respond to chatters",,

Users may find it easy or difficult to make friends.",People slightly disagree that making new friends is easy on Instagram.

This may be because Reddit is topic driven and does not emphasize following other users, and conversations are often tied to a specific topic or subject.","Although there are few responses, people tend to agree that making new friends on Tumblr is easy. This may be due to Tumblr's culture of ""mutual"" followers, and the ability to chat via replying to posts or reblogging.","In general, people disagree that you can make new friends on TikTok. Since TikTok is only videos and you often cannot message people that are not following you, communication is de-emphasized.","There are very few responses to this question, with most people either slightly agreeing or disagreeing. This may be ebcause BeReal prioritizes your existing friends, and does not aim for you to make new friends through the platform.","People strongly disagree, since YouTube has no way to message other users or add friends, and recommends content for entertainment.","Responses vary here. In general, people slightly disagree, but many people do also agree. This may be subjective since Snapchat relies primarily on pre-existing friendships, through which some people are able to make new friends.","Users strongly disagree here. 4Chan allows no usernames or direct messaging, so staying in contact with an anonymous user will be difficult.","Responses vary, but people slightly disagree. This is because Twitch's design focuses more on individual streams rather than direct interaction between users, however people may still make friends from these streamer's communities.",,

However this is primarily limited to profile picture, header and description. Instagram does also allow users to feature stories on their profile as well.","People slightly agree that Reddit enables customization. This includes a profile picture, banner, display name and about section, but since following is de-emphasized, these features are entirely based on preference.","Most people strongly agree.

D1,TRUE,I see posts by small creators.,Q,"Q, most people see small creators","Q, people follow peers and professionals but may see posts from large organizations",Q,Q,"People see posts by small creeators more frequently on Reddit than average. This may be due to Reddit being a topic-based platform, and creator following is de-emphasized","Tumbr users say that they very frequently see posts by small creators.

Despite TikToks being one minute or less, meaning that users can view one or two TikToks then close the apQ, however the algorithm is also good at recommending more content to watch.","Unanimously, all users spend less than ten minutes per session. This is because BeReal has very little content, aside from posting within a 2 minute window and viewing friends' posts.","Watch time varies, but most people spend well beyond 10 minutes on YouTube. This is because most videos that are not YouTube Shorts are above ten minutes, with many streams and videos spanning over an hour","Nearly everyone uses Snapchat for ten minutes or less. This is because Snapchat is designed for short, quick interactions and disappearing messages emphasize temporary use.",Most people spend less than 10 minutes on 4Chan. These posts also tend to be short,"Most people spend over 30 minutes on Twitch, with many spending more than an hour.

D7,TRUE,I feel bored/unsatisfied after viewing content on the platform.,"Althought you'd except entertainment based platforms to rarely leave users unsatisfied, overall, users are occassionally unsatisfied.","Surprisingly, Facebook is one of the platforms that struggles the most compared to other media we asked about. This could be a variety of reasons, such as not enjoying your connections posts or the recommended content, or that our respondents for facebook skewed older and that generation reflects on their view experience differently. Whatever the reason, keep this in mind!","Infrequent LinkedIn users primarily use it as a digital resume, rather 
than for its content. The platform's corporate culture inherently makes 
the content less ""entertaining"" than it's contemporaries, leading to 
occasional user boredom, but this is expected and some users are satisfied with that.","This one a platform was one of the worst in terms of boredom.

,,Agency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1,TRUE,I can control what I see on the platform.,"Social media will always be tied to the content a user cultivates, whether thats from following creators or from trying to tune their recommendation algorithm. This isn't always a process that the user will always have minute control of, but the user will play at least a minimal roll.","The recommendation algorithm can feel out of a user's control. Although friendships are valuable on the platform, the lean towards newsfeed and other recommendation algorithms may make the user feel powerless at times.","Survey respondents may only user profile features, so the survey responses may not accurately reflect the feed.

Some of the tabloid content cannot be avoided",Users tend to troll other forums,"The long-form nature of Twitch content main users will chose to watch a streamer for a while, and then switch to another.

A2,TRUE,I can control the quantity and types of advertisements I see.,Most social media platforms use ads as a primary revenue source.,"Facebook makes $114 Billion dollars annually off of it's ad spots. Although there are some tools for hiding certain ads and understanding what demographics users are targetted as, they may not be widely known or understood by users. ","LinkedIn makes $3B dollars annunally off of it's ad spots. There are settings to disable personlized ads and a premium model, which may be why our participants y lean towards slightly disagree over strongly disagree, but this may just as well be because our survey respondents may primarily use profile features, when ads show up in the feed.","$231.8M, can turn of personalization","$17.4B, some tools, one of the best ad recommendation algortihmns for shopping, in our opinion","$438 Million, much lower than competitors","Not released figures, Complys with ad laws in certain states, but turning of personalization may not be avaliable to all users.

Your connections posts will show up frequently, which may or may not relate to your hobbies. ","LinkedIn is not known for a strong recommendation algorithm. The feed will mostly be comprised of posts your connections have likes or companies you have followed, not recommended content. The professional attitude means much of the content will not align with hobbies, but may align with your professional interests.","Although Twitter recommendation algortihm will recommend you your interests, it is not as strong at it as it's video counterparts.","Although Instagram's recommendation algortihm will recommend you your interests, it is not as strong at it as it's video counterparts.","Although Reddit's recommendation or ""hotness"" algortihm will recommend you your interests, it is not as strong at it as it's video counterparts.","Tumblr's content depends on what you follow; tags and blogs. Although tumblr is experimenting wiht recommendation algorithmns, the general user base hasn't warmed up to it yet and instead rely on their own content filtering.","Along with Youtube, Tik Tok's watch-time based video recommendation algorithm is good at finding videos that align with user interests. As long as you watch videos you are interested in, the algorithmn will get better at showing you videos you are interested in. With lower barrier to entry due to shorter videos and trends, there is more content for the algorithmn to recommend even faster. ",BeReal does not have a recommendation alorithmn. It is exclusivly your friend's posts from within the last 24 hours.,"Along with Tiktok, Youtube's watch-time based video recommendation algorithm is good at finding videos that align with user interests. As long as you watch videos you are interested in, the algorithmn will get better at showing you videos you are interested in.",Snapchat's tabloid content and lack of creators makes it weaker than other social media for recommendations. It is much stronger as a messenger app.,"4Chan is known for shocking content and completely lack a recommendation algorithmn, so users do not often go there to find stuff they know they will like.. ","There is high variance in these answers. Twitch tends to recommend channels based on view count or content types you have previously watched (for example. if you watch a streamer play a video game, you may be recommended other streamers playing this game).
