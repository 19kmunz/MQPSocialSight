                                        granular preference based on degrees of connection to a person. The business
                                        focused culture keep interactions clean and professional, so issues like
                                        bullying and hate speech are often mitigated by the culture.</p>

                                        entertainment purposes as often as other media. There are features for saving
                                        posts and jobs, but those rely on user action, and it;s search features aid
                                        primarily in finding pages and current chatter, not revisiting a post. Our users
                                        may primarily use profile features, so this data may be skewed.</p>
