    <h3>Future Work</h3>
    <p>This project was aimed to compare and contrast social media, which is a new field of research that will be
        beneficial to consumers of social media. This effort is an early exploration of tools that can provide website
        for
        an informed online social media experience. In future explorations of this subject, there are many action items
        that should be done more systematically for a better final product. We have five key suggestions:</p>

                    Further exploration of our framework is necessary. To ensure users agree on the
                    qualitative features and feelings of social media, the survey design should be heavily scrutinized
                    and multiple rounds of survey distribution and re-analysis must be conducted to ensure validity of
                    the model. Experts in the field of data analysis and psychology should be consulted to make sure
                    best practices are followed in future survey designs.
                    <br>
                    A round of pre-testing on the questions should be conducted in the form of a cognitive interview to
                    validate that the language is consistently understood by all prospective participants.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Factor analysis uses statistical analysis to determine the underlying factors that affect related
                    variables. Our framework assumes that all the questions linked to each category actually have a
                    statistically underlying link, but without a factor analysis, there is no proof that that is the
                    case. A future study should be conducted with general questions decoupled from our framework to
                    determine the best framework to compare media with each other.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Instead of measuring the platforms directly in the survey, like our current approach, an approach
                    similar to the Quantic Foundry Gamer Motivation survey can be employed. First, researchers would run
                    a different survey to determine user motivations for social media, then these results would be put
                    under factor analysis.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="data">
                <p class="card-text">Our final website employs basic visualizations using boxplots, barcharts, and a
                    scatterplot. In future iterations of this website, clearer visualization options are possible. </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    We suggest a radar chart instead of a scatter plot to summarize the framework scales. The
                    scatterplot does allow for quick identification of groups of similar social media, but our version
                    necessitates contrasting two scales with each other on the same axis, implying they are of the same
                    continuity, which may not be the case.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    We suggest diverging Likert scales over boxplots for comparing social media on specific questions.
                    Both show the distribution of data in a way that is independent of the number of responses, but the
                    boxplot is harder to read, especially with Likert data. On continuous data, like decimal numbers,
                    boxplots can vary greatly and summarize diverse data well, but with discrete Likert data, boxplots
                    are capable of only a set number of configurations. Our boxplots struggle with median lines
                    intersecting with quartile boxes, which are hard to instantly understand.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    At the end of the survey, users could optionally fill out demographic information like race,
                    ethnicity, gender, etc. This quickly became out of scope. In future versions of this website, we
                    encourage promoting diverse opinions on social media platforms. Some platforms may struggle with
                    prejudice more than others, and concerned users should be aware of this before being encouraged to
                    join.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="analysis">
                <p class=" card-text">Social media is constantly changing and expanding. Within the scope of our
                    project, we self-selected twelve social media to analyze in-depth. However even during our period of
                    research, the social media we analyzed had major design changes. For example, TikTok recently
                    released a feature called TikTok Now, mimicking the BeReal application. These features are
                    significant and affect the culture and structure of the platforms. Any such changes affect the
                    relevance of the information we present on our website. However, we did not have the time to stay up
                    to date on all design changes. We suggest that future researchers re-analyze our original 12 social
                    media, as well as track the changes to sites over time.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    With a larger window of time, we believe that more diverse social media should be analyzed. In
                    particular, we emphasize Mastodon, an open-source social media with a similar format to Twitter, as
                    well as international social media including Chinese apps Sina Weibo and WeChat. We also wanted to
                    examine right-wing social media such as Truth Social, Gab and Parlor, but decided that these had too
                    small of a user base. Two other social media we considered were Pinterest and iFunny, both of which
                    are image-focused but de-emphasize other social aspects. We also considered the Steam Community tab,
                    messenger apps including Discord and WhatsApp, and movie review app Letterboxd, but none of these
                    were considered mainstream or social enough.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    We suggest an analysis of social media sub-communities. While some social media like BeReal do not
                    have public communities, forum-based social media like Reddit and 4chan depend on these. The two
                    most popular 4chan boards are /b (random) and /pol (politics), both of which allow open and
                    unmoderated discussion. As each community will encourage different behavior, we believe that a
                    deep-dive on any particular social media should also include the culture of popular communities,
                    particularly the difference in user culture between hostile communities.This information can help
                    concerned or vulnerable users keep themselves safe.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="website">
                <p class="card-text">Although the code powering the site is public, the survey data running the social
                    media rankings is not. The scope of this project only allowed for a single survey run, but these
                    platforms are constantly changing in culture, features, and more. </p>
                <p class="card-text"> This survey should be constantly available so the website can be constantly
                    updated as platforms change. An approach similar to IMdB or Common Sense Media where users can
                    submit public ratings to “review” each platform. Since platforms and the media on them are so
                    diverse, a simple 5-star system will not suffice, and would be redundant as app stores commonly
                    include that as a feature. Instead, ratings would need to be tied to different specific scales, or
                    obfuscated by a survey. </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    This website hopes to provoke thought and conversation on social media design, so, to further
                    facilitate that, public discussion should be embedded into the website. A public comment section on
                    each platform page would be the simplest form of communication to implement, but struggles with
                    searchability as the number of comments grows. A linked forum system may be enough structure to
                    enable conversation, but is not a modern design set, so it may not be accessible to younger users.
                    Featured conversations and case studies should be featured on each page to encourage interested
                    parties to research further.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane" id="outreach">
                <p class="card-text">Our final recommendation is to better promote the website and research. We want our
                    website to be an outreach tool, and we feel that our outreach was less than what we originally
                    envisioned. In particular, we suggest utilizing popular social media to promote the website and
                    continued research.</p>
                <p class="card-text"> Future work should utilize detailed videos posted to YouTube that demonstrate the
                    website, or use the website to provide overviews of each social media. Smaller clips demonstrating a
                    specific feature or fact, whether these are snippets from longer videos or filmed separately, should
                    be posted to TikTok, Instagram and YouTube as well. Screenshots of the website should also be
                    promoted where possible, including forums or tags related to social media and design. If funds
                    allow, advertising findings about social media on each platform may serve as a good tool to
                    reach users of social media.
