    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
        Our project aims to create a tool to help people better understand the landscape of social media from four
        different scales to compare the strengths and weaknesses of social media. To complete this goal, we identified
        four key objectives:</p>

                <p class=" card-text">
                    Our first approach to analyze social media sites was to examine the design
                    features of each platform. We also examined each platform's revenue generation and advertising
                    strategies, and identified similarities and differences between platforms.
                    <br>
                    To gain an overall view of a social media, it is important to understand the scale of its user base,
                    as well as how an owner makes a profit off of their users. In order to examine each social media, we
                    collected the following data:
                </p>
                <ul class="card-text">
                    <li>Annual Revenue: to provide insight into the financial success of the platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>Parent Company and/or Owner, to provide context on the management of the platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>Monthly Users, to quantify the user base and popularity of the platform.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="card-text">
                    We narrowed down key questions about design to determine what was available or missing from various
                    platforms. Additionally, we collected all relevant design features per social media, and condensed
                    the list into a ranked top-three list.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    The following questions were used to analyze revenue and funding methods:

                <ul class="card-text">
                    <li>Are there advertisements? Are these advertisements recommended?
                    </li>
                    <li>What is the advertising revenue (if public)?
                    </li>
                    <li>Is user data being sold? To whom?
                    </li>
                    <li>Does it accept donations?
                    </li>
                    <li>Is it a publicly traded company?

                <p class="card-text">
                    The data was collected through secondary research and analyzed using qualitative and quantitative
                    methods to identify patterns and trends. The findings were used to compare and contrast the
                    different social media platforms, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

                <p class=" card-text">
                    Our personal experience with social media will affect how we perceive and analyze this subject. As
                    both of us are college students, the time period in which we were raised will give us a better
                    understanding of some social media over others.
                    <br>
                    Following is a quick estimate of our personal experience with each. “Extensive user” means visiting
                    the platform daily or more than daily, while “intermittent user” means visiting the platform
                    approximately once a week or once a month. These dates are not precise, but should serve as a
                    helpful guide for potential bias for future analysis of our findings.

                <p class=" card-text">
                    To evaluate and compare social media platforms, metrics to measure must be defined. We started
                    searching for these metrics by brainstorming our motivations coming into the project.
                    As users of social media, we are concerned with the spread of misinformation, echo chambers,
                    addictive design, parasocial relationships, and the safety and happiness of users.
                </p>
                <p class=" card-text">
                    Our two primary inspirations from our framework were <a

                    Gamer Motivation Profile</a> and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1989586" target="_blank">theoretical
                    "4 C's" framework</a> outlined by Hoffman and Novak at George Washington University School of
                    Business.
                </p>
                <p class=" card-text">
                    After further sketching, brainstorming and discussion, we designed our final framework to consist of
                    four scales that social media platforms can be designed to encourage or discourage: Community,
                    Self-Expression, Discovery, and Agency.
                </p>
                <ul class="card-text">
                    <li>Community on social media measures our social tendencies to connect with others on the internet.
                        If social media encourages empathy, talking with your friends, family, and loved ones, or
                        enables discussion amongst a like-minded group, it encourages community.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Self-Expression scale relates to how social media enables self-presentation,
                        self-exploration, and the ego. This scale aims to measure how a platform encourages identity
                        presentation or getting lost in the crowd.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Discovery scale relates to a user’s desire to see something new. Scrolling through social
                        media for non-social reasons often means looking for something new to entertain, educate, or
                        fascinate. For there to be new content for a user to discover, new creators need to be
                        encouraged by the platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>Agency is related to user safety and comfort. Sometimes users are not looking for anything new,
                        but instead old comfortable memories or their favorite videos from a while ago.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="card-text">
                    We want to emphasize that our framework is up to interpretation and needs additional evidence before
                    widespread adoption. We feel Community, Self, Discovery, and Agency are good scales to compare the
                    strengths and weaknesses of social media and is a good enough framework to discuss the complexities
                    of social media

                <p class="card-text">
                    Once the framework was completed, designed a survey for users to evaluate their social media of
                    choice on these scales. We designed 5-8 questions that we believe are linked to each scale. We
                    posted to the WPI student Discord server, the WPI subreddit, and the WPI Parents Facebook page.
                    Furthermore, we distributed the survey amongst friends and encouraged them to share with anyone they
                    felt would be interested. This means our data is skewed towards people associated with the WPI
                    community, but the data can still be viewed for an understanding of social media trends.

                    The three data visualizations we researched before beginning the website were: box plots (for
                    individual questions, framework scales, and comparisons), bar charts (for individual questions, and
                    framework scales), and a scatter plot (for a comparison on framework scales). Boxplots work well for
                    summarizing the distribution of data, but can hide the shape of data as well as outliers. Barcharts
                    show the shape of the data with granularity. The scatterplots display groups of data well. Our data
                    will be plotted on four scales, so we could either juxtapose pairs of scales on the x and y axis or
                    create four scatterplots.

                    Throughout each session, we followed the Think Out Loud (TOL) Study framework, which allows
                    participants to make comments out loud and explain their thoughts about four pages on our website,
                    without us asking leading questions. We also encouraged participants to vocalize any questions or
                    concerns they might have, including asking for help. Additionally, we have written a series of
                    questions to assess whether the website is easy to use, whether the information is understandable to
                    users, and whether the information is unique and valuable to users. These questions were asked after
                    the participant viewed each page, to gain an understanding of the value of each individual page.
