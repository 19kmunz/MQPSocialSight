            <p>Facebook features an infinitely scrollable feed of photos, videos, and texts, both from people you know
                and suggested by Facebook. On Facebook you can build and maintain a profile to present yourself - your
                photos, thoughts, ideas and activities. You can connect with people you may know or groups of strangers
                by sharing or re-sharing posts, publicly commenting, or private messaging. Your Home feed includes
                suggested content, while the Feeds tab allows you to curate a filtered list of content you want to see,
                without suggestions.

                                    <p class="col">Facebook has struggled with its content moderation. Reportedly,
                                        Facebook used to prioritized posts with "angry" reactions in the news feed,
                                        which was criticized for likely spreading more controversial content that could
                                        lead to more controversy within user spaces. Facebook struggles with scammers
                                        and data harvesting with third party apps, which can lead to, in the worst
                                        cases, identity theft.</p>
